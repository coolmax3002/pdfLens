# pdfLens

Detects documents and converts them in to pdfs.

Take a picture with your webcam using the escape key or provide a path to a png or jpg.

There are many limitations to this as this a simple implementation of a document scanner. The document should completely be in the frame of the image, there should not be too much "noise" around the document as it may mess up detection, the image must be taken some what close to a birds eye angle, a higher resolution picture will lead to a better result.
